# CH-Hospital

ChOspital is a private hospital in Lugano which in addition to the emergency treatments, hospitalization, and rehabilitation, patients can book ordinary treatments or exams. Focusing on the latter function, a service to manage exams is offered. 
Once the patient wants to book for an exam, s/he goes to the desk or connect via the web app to submit a new request. The request is managed by a secretary, which will approve or decline the request using a desktop app. In case of acceptance the secretary defines the data and request for the payment, otherwise a notification to the customer is sent. At that time the patient will go to the hospital to do the exam and, after 10 days s/he can return to the desk for getting the exam or obtaining them via web.

To support this service, ChOspital has an enterprise system composed of a CRM which will be used by the secretary to book the exam, and an ERP which will be used by the secretary to define the date and manage the next operations. About the payments, everything is managed via a credit card circuit to which the backoffice is connected.  This system can be used by the secretary via a desktop app in case the patient pays at the desk, or via web page directly by the patient.
