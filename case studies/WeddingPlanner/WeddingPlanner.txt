When a wedding planner is contacted by the couple for organizing the event, s/he informed about the desired date and the type of wedding (e.g., romantic, minimal). The wedding planner, after discussing with her/his collaborator can decide the accept or reject the offering. In the latter case the process ends. In the former case, the wedding planner sends a questionnaire to the couple and while s/he is waiting for the answers, an initial set of basic suppliers (e.g., restaurants, location providers) are contacted informing about the need to reserve the date. Once the feedback from the couple has been received, based on the answers, an additional set of suppliers will be informed about the wedding date. The day before the wedding, the couple will receive by the wedding planner a set of photos and videos related to the location that has been prepared for the event. It might also happen that the couple decides to cancel the wedding. If this happens more than a month in advance w.r.t. the wedding date, the wedding planner will send a message to all the suppliers to cancel the work. Otherwise, the wedding planner will inform only the additional suppliers.
