# Case studies

Teaching material is built around case studies. In this folder, for each case study, a description of the case and a basic set of diagrams are offered to describe a fictious but realistic scenario.

Archimate is adopted as a modeling language to show the business requirements, the application functions, and the technology offerings. BPMN
BPMN is used to model both the agreement among the different parties involved in the case studies in terms of a choreographed process, and the orchestrated processes.
