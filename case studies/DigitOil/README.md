# DigitOil

DigitOil is a an olive oil company located in Southern Italy that is leveraging on the new technologies to improve its internal processes. In particular, a key process of the company concerns all the activities required to plan the seasonal oil harvesting. In fact, selecting the right period and minimizing the time from the harvesting to the olives squeezing deeply affect the quality of the final product. 

The process is composed of the following activities: to decide when to pick the olives, to schedule the distribution to the affiliated mills according to their availabilities, to deliver the olives to the mills, to squeeze the olives, and finally to store the oil in the company's warehouses.

The production manager is responsible for all the activities and s/he relies on an agronomist to decide when to pick the olives. Because of the importance of the process the production manager must be always ready to report to the CEO about the status of the process. 

To support the process, a set of applications are available. First of all, the data warehouse is used by the agronomist to analyse the fields and to identify the best period to start the picking. Moreover, the installed ERP - in addition to the usual functionalities referring to the production and resource management -offers a specific support to the mill planning and oil warehousing.
